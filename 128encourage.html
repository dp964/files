Prayer is best. As an encouragement and to help understanding (excuse the length)

 I will be needing just enough space  from you(s) only for this one reason; the private and personal reasons don't concern any of you at this point (sorry!)

As a Christian community, we should be welcoming, loving, caring, giving, encouraging; and friendships are good amongst the church; as we are all under and belong to Jesus.

However we need to avoid is too much emotional connection or dependency/intimacy between a brother and sister (of which is only best appropriated between married couples); which includes affecting people's emotions in a negative or ungodly manner, such as causing a sister (or brother) to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome/unloved. When it happens online, it can be exaggerated as well. 

Of course that definitely doesn't excuse us from loving, praying, giving, encouraging each other in appropriate  ways; often the most practical way to care is to allow for or encourage for those where it is most appropriate. 

This is what is helpful to be aware of, not just with me but also other brothers. And the same goes for me.
 What is actually helpful, will differ from brother to brother; but in generality, it can help to be clear and consistent when communicating.

And an encouragement from the Word to continue:
“Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.” ‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭5:12-13‬

We all need Gods help, as I know I have and will fail; as will you all; and sometimes need to take time and space to allow for him to work in us and others. :)

So that is my main thinking behind yesterday's message.

Desiring God has some helpful articles such as these. But it is worth reflecting and seeking to grow under the counsel of older trustworthy Christian women.

Why? In hope that all may be as mature men and women in Christ (Col 1:28) as one body under His Lordship for His Glory.
I think I don't need to say anything more.
